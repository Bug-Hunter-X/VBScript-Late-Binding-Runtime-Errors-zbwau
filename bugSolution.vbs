Error Handling and Early Binding:

Using On Error Resume Next to gracefully handle potential errors and implementing early binding when feasible are the primary solutions:

Error Handling Example:
```vbscript
On Error Resume Next
Set objExcel = CreateObject("Excel.Application")
If Err.Number <> 0 Then
  WScript.Echo "Error creating Excel object: " & Err.Description
  Err.Clear
Else
  'Use the object (handle potential further errors with On Error)
  'objExcel.Visible = True
  'objExcel.Quit
End If
Set objExcel = Nothing
```
Early Binding Example (Requires explicit reference to the Excel object library):
```vbscript
Dim objExcel As Object
Set objExcel = CreateObject("Excel.Application")
' Accessing members is safer; if the method doesn't exist the compiler may catch it early
' objExcel.Visible = True
' objExcel.Quit
Set objExcel = Nothing
```
Note: Early binding requires adding a reference to the relevant library in your development environment (such as VBA editor).  Error handling should generally be used in addition to early binding to manage other runtime unexpected situations.
